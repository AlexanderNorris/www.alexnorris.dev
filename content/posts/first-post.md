My name is Alex, these days I would call myself a site reliability engineer (SRE) but I've held the title of network engineer, systems engineer and software engineer. I enjoy tech a great deal and could never have the life I lead without it, this goes doubly for open source software (OSS) which has enabled my entire career including big hitters like Linux, Django, Zabbix, Prometheus, and Hugo.

I hope to share some interesting posts about my technical ventures here.
